## 🧠 About
I work close to the protocol layer.

I’m interested in how distributed systems, cryptography, and incentives interact, especially in:
- Ethereum and EVM-based systems  
- Zero-knowledge proofs and zkVM-style architectures  
- Smart contract security, protocol design, and mechanism design  

I like reading specs, breaking assumptions, and implementing things from first principles.

## 🔬 Current Focus
- Zero-knowledge circuits and proof systems (learning by building)
- Protocol-level Solidity and Rust
- L2s, rollups, and cross-chain primitives
- Research-driven engineering (papers → code → tests)

If it involves constraints, gas costs, or adversarial environments, I’m probably interested.

## 📜 Certifications
Background in cloud and data systems (useful context, not the main focus now):
- Azure Administrator / Developer / Fundamentals  
- Power BI Data Analyst
